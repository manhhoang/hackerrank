Problem Statement

Some superstitious people believe that Friday the 13th is a day that is very unlucky.

However, Sergey does not agree with them. In order to prove this to people that nothing scary will happen, he wants to choose two dates and count the number of Friday the 13th's between them. 
If this number is reasonably large, he will be able to tell that it is just a regular day.

But now Sergey is quite busy, so he is unable to calculate the number of Fridays the 13th's between the specific dates. Could you write a program that will do it for him?

Input Format

The first line of input consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then, there are T lines describing the test cases.

The first (and only) line of the test case contain six single space-separated integers D1 M1 Y1 D2 M2 Y2, denoting two dates in the DD MM YYYY format both. 
It is guaranteed that they describe two existing dates and the first date is not later than the second one.

Constraints 
1≤T≤10 
1900≤Y1≤Y2≤9999 
D1,M1,Y1 describing a correct date 
D2,M2,Y2 describing a correct date 
The date, described by D1,M1,Y1 is not later than the date described by D2,M2,Y2.

Output Format

For each specified range of dates output the number of Fridays the 13th's on a separate line.
