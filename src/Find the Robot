Problem Statement

There is a robot, initially standing at the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system. The coordinates of the robot are, therefore, (0,0). Then, the robot makes N turns.

On the first turn, the robot goes 1 unit to the right.
On the second turn, the robot goes 2 units up.
On the third turn, the robot goes 3 units to the left.
On the fourth turn, the robot goes 4 units down.
On the fifth turn, the robot goes 5 units to the right.
And so on.
Your task is to determine the position of the robot after performing all the N turns.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases followed by T lines describing the test cases.

Each line contains a single integer - the value of N, for the corresponding test case.

Constraints 
1≤T≤100 
1≤N≤10^9
Output Format

For each test case output a single line, containing two integers - the coordinates of the robot after performing N turns.

Sample Input

Sample Output

1 0
1 2

-2 -2

Explanation

Initially, the robot is standing at the point (0,0).

On the first turn, it moves 1 unit to the right, thus it's new position becomes (1,0).

On the second turn, it moves 2 units up, thus it's new position becomes (1,2).

On the third turn, it moves 3 units to the left, thus it's new position becomes (−2,2).

On the fourth turn, it moves 4 units down, thus it's new position becomes (−2,−2).
