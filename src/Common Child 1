HARRY
SALLY





Problem Statement

Given two strings a and b of equal length, what's the longest string (S) that can be constructed such that it is a child of both? 

A string x is said to be a child of a string y if x can be formed by deleting zero or more characters from y. 

For example, ‘‘abcd" and ‘‘abdc" has two children with maximum length 3, ‘‘abc" and ‘‘abd". Note that we will not consider ‘‘abcd" as a common child because ′c′ doesn't occur before ′d′ in the second string.

Input Format

Two strings, a and b, with a newline separating them.

Constraints

All characters are in uppercase and lie between ASCII values 65-90. The maximum length of the strings is 5000.

Output Format

Length of string S.
