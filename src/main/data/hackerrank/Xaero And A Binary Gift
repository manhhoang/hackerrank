Problem Statement

Today is Xaero's birthday. His mom decided to surprise him with a truly fantastic gift: his favourite binary string A. But, unfortunately, all the stocks of binary string A have been sold out, and only a binary string B ( A≠B ) is available in the market.

She purchased a binary string B and tries to convert it to binary string A by applying the given SWAP operation zero or more times.

Explanation:

SWAP
Let the string B of the form B1B2..Bi....Bj..Bn
Choose 2 indices i and j such that 1≤i,j≤|B|, where |B| denotes the length of string B.
Swap the binary bits present at index i and j i.e. Bi and Bj.
Resultant String = B1B2..Bj....Bi..Bn.
Your task is to help Xaero's mom by telling her the minimum number of swap operations required to convert binary string B to binary string A.

Input Format

First line of input contains a binary string A. 
Second line of input contains a binary string B.

Constraints

1≤|A|,|B|≤103 
Ai,Bi∈ {0,1} 
A≠B
Output Format

If it is possible to convert binary string B to binary string A, output the minimum number of operations required for the conversion, otherwise, output −1.

Explanation

Test 1: Binary string B can be converted to binary string A using following set of SWAP operations.

Applying SWAP operation on indices 1 and 2. Resultant string will be 1010.
Applying SWAP operation on indices 3 and 4. Resultant string will be 1001.
Test 2: Binary string B cannot be converted to binary string A.

Test 3: Binary string B cannot be converted to binary string A.
