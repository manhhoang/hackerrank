Problem Statement

You are given two strings, A and B. Find if there is a substring that appears in both A and B.

Input Format

Several test cases will be given to you in a single file. The first line of the input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.

Then there will be T descriptions of the test cases. Each description contains two lines. The first line contains the string A and the second line contains the string B.

Output Format

For each test case, display YES (in a newline), if there is a common substring. Otherwise, display NO.

Constraints

All the strings contain only lowercase Latin letters.
1<=T<=10
1<=|A|,|B|<=105
Sample Input

hello
world
hi
world
Sample Output

YES
NO
Explanation

For the 1st test case, the letter o is common between both strings, hence the answer YES. 
For the 2nd test case, hi and world do not have a common substring, hence the answer NO.
