Problem Statement

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Longest common subsequence (LCS) of 2 sequences is a subsequence, with maximal length, which is common to both the sequences. 

Given two sequence of integers, A=[a1,a2,…,an] and B=[b1,b2,…,bm], find any one longest common subsequence.

In case multiple solutions exist, print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one non-empty common subsequence will exist.

Input Format

First line contains two space separated integers, n and m, where n is the size of sequence A, while m is size of sequence B. In next line there are n space separated integers representing sequence A, and in third line there are m space separated integers representing sequence B.

n m
A1 A2 … An 
B1 B2 … Bm  
Constraints

1≤n≤100 
1≤m≤100 
0≤ai<1000,where i∈[1,n] 
0≤bj<1000,where j∈[1,m]

Output Format

Print the longest common subsequence and each element should be separated by at least one white-space. In case of multiple answers, print any one of them.

Sample Input

1 2 3 4 1
3 4 1 2 1 3
Sample Output

1 2 3
Explanation

There is no common subsequence with length larger than 3. And "1 2 3", "1 2 1", "3 4 1" are all correct answers.
