	The first ball get 5 score, total is 5
	The next ball get -2 score, total is 5 - 2 = 3. Last score is -2
	The next ball get 4 score, total is 5 - 2 + 4 = 7. Last score is 4
	The next ball get Z, total is 5 - 2 + 4  4 = 3. Last score is -2
	The next ball get X, total is 5  2 + 4  4  4 = -1. Last score is  4
	The next ball get 9, total is 5 - 2 + 4  4  4 + 9 = 8. Last score is 9
	The next ball get +, total is 5  2 + 4  4 + 9 + 5 = 13. Last score is 5
	The next ball get +, total is 5  2 + 4  4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.
