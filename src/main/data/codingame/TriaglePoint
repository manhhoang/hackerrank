The program:
Your program must determine whether the given points are within the triangle.

INPUT:
3 first lines: Two space separated integers (x, y) corresponding to the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.
Line 4: The number N of points to test.
N next lines: Two space separated integers (x, y) corresponding to the coordinates of the point to test.

OUTPUT:
N lines contening, for each point, "IN" if the point is inside the triangle and "OUT" otherwise.

CONSTRAINTS:
-10000 < x < 10000
-10000 < y < 10000
0 < N < 100
