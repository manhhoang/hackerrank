You are given a set, SS, of NN distinct integers. Perform the operation below on the set until such a point as the size of the set (|S||S|) no longer changes when the operation is performed. The operation is as follows:

Choose any 22 distinct numbers, xx and yy, in set SS. Calculate their absolute difference (|x−y||x−y|), and insert the result into the set. Recall that a set is a collection of distinct objects, so |S||S| will not change if you attempt to insert a value it already contains.

Perform the above operation on SS until until |S||S| no longer changes. Then print the MthMth greatest number present in the final set.

Note: It is guaranteed that |S|≥M|S|≥M.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, NN, denoting the size of the initial set. 
The second line contains NN space-separated integers denoting the elements present in the initial set, SS. 
The third line contains an integer, MM (our output is the MthMth greatest integer in the final set).

Constraints

All integers in initial set SS are ≤105≤105
Output Format

Print the MthMth greatest integer in the final set on a new line.

Explanation

Our initial set S=[2,6,10]S=[2,6,10], and we will refer to the set resulting from an operation as S′S′.

S=[2,6,10]S=[2,6,10]. We choose x=2x=2 and y=6y=6. We insert |2−6|=4|2−6|=4 into the set, resulting in S′=[2,4,6,10]S′=[2,4,6,10].
S=[2,4,6,8]S=[2,4,6,8]. We choose x=2x=2 and y=10y=10. We insert |2−10|=8|2−10|=8 into the set, resulting in S′=[2,4,6,8,10]S′=[2,4,6,8,10].
At this point, no operation using any possible xx and yy combination will result in any new numbers being added to the set. Thus, our final set of integers is [2,4,6,8,10][2,4,6,8,10].

M=2M=2, and our MthMth (2nd2nd) greatest integer in [2,4,6,8,10][2,4,6,8,10] is 88, so we print 88 on a new line.
